This version of KF assumes that each object can occur at most num_max times in one frame
the calculations of the Kalman Filter are as follows:

prediction:
x = F x + B u[n] 
P = F P Ft + Q

compute the Kalman Gain
S = H P Ht + R
K = P Ht np.linalg.pinv(S)

update the estimate via Z
Z = m x[n]
y = Z - H x
x = x + K y

update the error covariance
